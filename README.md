# CS408 - Computer Networks  
*Sabancı University – Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences*

## Course Overview

**CS408: Computer Networks** is a senior-level undergraduate course at Sabancı University that introduces the core principles and practices of data communication and networking.

The course covers both theoretical foundations and practical implementations of computer networks. Students learn about network architectures, protocols, and services through lectures, labs, and programming assignments.

### Topics Covered

- OSI and TCP/IP protocol stacks  
- Application layer protocols (HTTP, DNS, SMTP)  
- Transport layer: TCP and UDP protocols  
- Socket programming and concurrency  
- Network layer: IP addressing, routing algorithms  
- Link layer protocols (Ethernet, ARP)  
- Wireless and mobile networking  
- Network security basics

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students are expected to:
- Understand how data is transmitted over networks
- Analyze and design network protocols and services
- Build networked applications using sockets
- Evaluate performance and reliability of different network layers

### Tools and Technologies

- TCP/UDP Sockets  
- Wireshark Packet Analyzer  
- C, C++, Python, or C# for socket programming  
- Network simulation tools (optional)
